This is Crawl.

In this project, that was intended to be a rpg-esque dungeon crawler, you must find your way through multiple levels of dungeon mazes while combating enemies that follow you
wherever you go. They live here; they can climb walls, traverse pits; and they will stop at nothing to make sure you never come back to their home... or that your body never
leaves...

Our goals for this project:
- Create an interactive dungeon crawler game that includes real-time combat and interaction with enemies and overworld objects.
- The ability to traverse levels as you beat them, moving to the next stage; each will be more difficult than the last.
- Implement a way to save player files, allowing them to come back later and pick up from where they left off.
- Include multiple enemy types for a more diverse combat experience, including possibly having dungeon bosses.
- And most importantly of all... Make it easy to add on to the game. Levels are read in from a text file, allowing users to write their own level and insert it into the 
  project, obstacles, items, enemies, and all.

What we accomplished:
- A somewhat-interactive overworld experience. Combat with enemies is possible, but picking up/dropping items has not been implemented
- Levels are easily created and read-in, but they take a while to properly design, so for now all we have is a "demo" level where enemies follow you around and you must
  destroy all of them.
- The profile saving works, but has not yet been properly added into the game, and a login screen has not been designed or programmed into the menu, so it could not be
  included in this version
- We originally had multiple enemy types, but we decided to only include one for the time being to simplify the demo experience. More will come, however, we assure you.

This has been an awesome experience, and you bet that a few of us will still be working on this over the summer and beyond.
